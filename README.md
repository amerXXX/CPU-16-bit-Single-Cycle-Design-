# CPU-16-bit-Single-Cycle-Design-
Design and implementation of a 16-bit single-cycle RISC CPU in Logisim-Evolution. It supports arithmetic, logic, memory, branch, and bit-reversal instructions. A five-stage pipeline with forwarding and hazard detection ensures correct execution. Test programs validate loops, branches, and procedure calls. Future work explores multi-cycle designs.
